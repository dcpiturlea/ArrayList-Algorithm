The application consist in a Java Corre Program which have multiple classes.

The main class call the method ChoseTheFunction from the class GetArrayFunction.
This method create an ArrayList and the same call the methods generateRandomArray and printArray from ArrayStructures(by inheritance). 
This two methods create an array and populates it with random numbers and the second method print the array("graphically").

The class GetArrayFunction(ChoseTheFunction method) have un swhitch which is called by main class. 
With his help the user can chose multiples functions.
For now the application have only two functions(methods with wich the user can manipulate the Array):

  1. The user can search if a value exist in the arraylist. If yes, the application print how many time and the position where the value is.
If the value does not exist in the array the app print that.
  2. The user can search a value depinding on the index the user enters
